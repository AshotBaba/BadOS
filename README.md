# BadOS
Fun BadUSB scripts for iOS! Tested with BadBLE Made for the Flipper Zero!

ㅤ

More Custom script TOOLs for iOS, instead of those boring basic scripts like opeing a website then inserts a URL. 
ㅤ

But with some of these scripts you can get more keyboard access for iPad and iPhone!

such as :

ㅤ

The "Caught in 4k" Script

Description : Opens up a sepcific link and screenshots what your looking at :)

ㅤ

The "Discord Spam" Script

Description : Automatically types out a certain text and sends it quickly (works with more apps besides discord

ㅤ

The "DUCKs" Script

Description : types out a long paragraph about ducks

ㅤ

The "LR Swiper" Script

Description : Goes through the device and check out everything (is not perfect)

ㅤ

ㅤ

The "Not MY TABS" Script
